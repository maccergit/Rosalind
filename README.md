# Rosalind
Eclipse projects for Rosalind

Rosalind is a platform for learning bioinformatics and programming through problem solving, and has a bias towards using Python to solve the problems (it includes a small Python course, and the utility libraries that are recommended are Python).  Since bioinformatics is text and graph oriented, it's a nice counterpoint to the numeric processing of Euler.  See http://rosalind.info for more info.

This repo holds the Eclipse pydev projects I am using to explore Rosalind.
