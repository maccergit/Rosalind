Degree Array 

Given: A simple graph with nâ‰¤10^3 vertices in the edge list format.

Return: An array D[1..n] where D[i] is the degree of vertex i.

Sample Dataset
 6 7
 1 2
 2 3
 6 3
 5 6
 2 5
 2 4
 4 1

Sample Output
 2 4 2 2 2 2

Use the networkx library to handle graph stuff.

"""
Personal observations : 
- networkx is probably overkill for this project, but is probably useful for more complex graph problems.  Most of the code is building the graph structure in memory - the
actual computing of the degree list is a single call into the library.
- Rosalind edge list file format differs slightly from networkx edge list file format - networkx does not support the first line with vertex count and edge count.  By
reading the first line ourselves, we leave the file position in the correct place for networkx to read the rest of the file, and can then adjust the resulting graph to
take into account any lone vertices.
