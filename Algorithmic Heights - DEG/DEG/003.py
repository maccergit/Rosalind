Degree Array 

Given: A simple graph with nâ‰¤10^3 vertices in the edge list format.

Return: An array D[1..n] where D[i] is the degree of vertex i.

Sample Dataset
 6 7
 1 2
 2 3
 6 3
 5 6
 2 5
 2 4
 4 1

Sample Output
 2 4 2 2 2 2

Use the utility class to handle Rosalind formatted data.

Personal observations : 
- Getting PyDev to handle imports from other projects in the same workspace is a bit of a pain, but can be done.  Probably need to play with this more to get a better
feel for how to manage namespaces so they do not pollute the global namespace so much (I would like to import "utility.graph", not just "graph".
- The previous version that converted Rosalind formatted data was coplex enough to warrant separation into a utility modulw, making this version much cleaner.
