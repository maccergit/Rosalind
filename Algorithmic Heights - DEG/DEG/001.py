"""
Personal observations : 
- With a simple graph that is minimal (no duplicate edges), each vertex appears once on each edge that has that vertex as an endpoint.  Thus, we only need to count the
number of times the vertex appears in the edge list to get its degree.  Since the output is positional, we need to sort by vertex ID to get the correct output.
- The special case of vertices with no edges (and thus not connected to the graph) is not mentioned in the discussion.  May not actually be a simple graph, and not be 
necessary, but included for completeness.
