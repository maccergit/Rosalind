Double-Degree Array

Given: A simple graph with nâ‰¤10^3 vertices in the edge list format.

Return: An array D[1..n] where D[i] is the sum of the degrees of i's neighbors.

Sample Dataset
 5 4
 1 2
 2 3
 4 3
 2 4

Sample Output
 3 5 5 5 0

Use utility class to read Rosalind data to networkx graph, and then use that to compute results.
